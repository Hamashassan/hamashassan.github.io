Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of  science in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Iqra University](https://iqra.edu.pk/). Since then, I started developing Web and Mobile Apps projects, and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2017-2020)

Today, I'm currently working as a Software Engineer responsible for building advanced mobile applications for both Android and iOS using React Native platform.

At Cubix I also been awarded as a best performer [Always at 110% Award](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6812130371023462401/)

I am also a level-one seller on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/hamashassann). Worked with different clients around the globe.

Here is a list of the technologies that I work with in Cubix!
